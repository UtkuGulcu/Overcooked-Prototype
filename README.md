# Overcooked-Prototype
I tried to recreate overcooked in Unity following a tutorial from a youtube channel called Codemonkey. This project is the first project that I have used the Unity's new Input system. So I think this project improved me quite a lot as I used complex methods like interfaces and inheritance.
